# Wearing-Mask-COVID19

The dataset is from [kaggle]{https://www.kaggle.com/crained/wearingmaskc19} : 

The dataset contains 150 images. In each image there are people wearing or not wearing masks. 

We will test different neural networks including a simplified version of Xception. 
We will highlight the main problems linked to deep learning (overfiting, lack of data, etc.) and try to propose an approach to overcome these problems.
